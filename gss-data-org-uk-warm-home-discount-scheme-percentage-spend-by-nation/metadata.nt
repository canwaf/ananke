It comprises all participating suppliers in year 8 (2018/19) of the scheme.\nThe WHD is a government energy scheme which aims to help people who are in fuel poverty or are at risk of it. It focuses spending against three different support elements, categorised as ‘core group’, ‘broader group’ and ‘industry initiative’ spending.\nFor more on the scheme elements and how they work, see our overview page at Warm Home Discount:\nhttps://www.ofgem.gov.uk/environmental-programmes/social-programmes/warm-home-discount-whd\nWe have gathered this information from obligated suppliers for information purposes, and as such it should be considered as advisory only. Scheme year 5 (2015/6) was the first year we have collected this data.\nWe update this chart on an annual basis.\n"@en .
